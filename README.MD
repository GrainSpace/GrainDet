# Overview

This repository contains detailed information of our **A**utomated **V**ision-based system for **G**rain **A**ppearance **Insp**ection named **AV4GAInsp**. GAI plays a crucial role in global agriculture and human nutrition, thus ensuring food security and facilitating international trade. This project aims to expedite grain inspection by developing automated systems with deep learning techniques. The aim of this system is to provide assisents for inspectors in improving efficiency and accuracy. In addition, we release a dataset, named GrainDet, containing different types of ceral grains, with each type of grain including normal, impurities and six kinds of defective kernels.
